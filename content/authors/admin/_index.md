## Welcome!

I'm Fatemeh, an AI researcher with a passion for creating intelligent systems that are both reliable and easy to understand.
I earned my MSc in Computing Science from the University of Alberta, where I completed my thesis on program synthesis and reinforcement learning under the guidance of [Prof. Matthew E. Taylor](https://drmatttaylor.net/) and [Prof. Levi Lelis](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~santanad/).
During my studies, I was actively involved in [the Intelligent Robot Learning Lab](https://irll.ca), [the RLAI Lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/), and [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/).
